# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview 

Machine learning is the use of statistical algorithms to perform tasks such as learning from data patterns and making predictions. There are many different models—a model is a mathematical representation of something that happens in the real world—and you'll learn about several this week.

Broadly speaking, machine learning can be divided into three learning categories: supervised, unsupervised, and deep. For our purposes, we'll only discuss supervised and unsupervised learning.`

Jill commends you for all your hard work. Piece by piece, you’ve been building up your skills in data preparation, statistical reasoning, and machine learning. You are now ready to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, you’ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Jill asks you to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, you’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, you’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, you’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once you’re done, you’ll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk.
Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk.
Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk.
Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md).

By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

Explain how a machine learning algorithm is used in data analytics.
Create training and test groups from a given data set.
Implement the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
Interpret the results of the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each supervised learning algorithm.
Determine which supervised learning algorithm is best used for a given data set or scenario.
Use ensemble and resampling techniques to improve model performance.

Deliverable 4: Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis
For this deliverable, you’ll write a brief summary and analysis of the performance of all the machine learning models used in this Challenge.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
